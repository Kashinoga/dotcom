		<h2>Play the Game</h2>
		<p>
			After the Storyhook, the game invites players to dive into their characters' destinies with a
			mixture of luck and skill.
		</p>

		<p>
			We use luck to represent the many unknowns that life may throw at us, and we use skill to
			represent the time and effort that we put into our very own lives.
		</p>

		<p>To further cement the use of luck and skill, we begin by employing a tarot deck.</p>

		<p>
			Later on, we'll look at our Character Sheets, as-in: what we use to represent our characters'
			skills.
		</p>

		<h2>Tarot</h2>
		<p>
			The game uses a tarot deck to help determine the outcome of actions taken by us, the players.
